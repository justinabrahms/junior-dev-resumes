##Have you written code for a company before?
I've had two internships for tech companies in the past.

##How many years have you been programming?
If HTML/CSS counts as programming, I started way back in elementary school and had lots of gaps in between. I learned about non-web programming languages in 2009, took a break until 2011 where I did lots of Java, and have been programming every year in college since 2013.

##What, if anything, has been the difficult part about developer job seeking?
Getting interviews - sometimes the online application feels like a black hole.
